# translation


## Installing
```bash
composer require onecode-no/translation
```

> **NOTE:** In order to use this package with Google Translate you need to add `GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY` to your environment variables. (Unless you run the translation driver in production it is enough to do it locally.)
